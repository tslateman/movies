This is a resubmition for the movie webpage project, so let's call
this version 1.1 to note the fixes. No new features introduced. 

Cleaned up code and comments to conform to style guidelines.

------------------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this project is to display a movie website that plays 
trailers when the user clicks on the movies. 

This was written for the first project of the Udacity Full Stack 
Developer nanodegree.

List Of Files

Be sure that you have saved in your directory the following files:

entertainment_center.py
fresh_tomatoes.py
media.py

You should also have this README file, but its not required to run.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Instructions For Usage

To view the webpage you will need to have Python installed first. 
This was created with 2.7.10, so if you want to match please select 
that version and install on your machine. Then to run the program,
navigate to the directory you saved the files and enter the following:

python entertainment_center.py

If you prefer a UI to the command line, python's IDLE is helpful.
To download python 2.7.10 or to get IDLE google "install python" or
go to https://www.python.org/downloads/ 

Upon executing you will generate two python compiled files and a
fresh_tomatoes HTML document that shows the movie webpage. The 
webpage should open up in your default browser automatically. It
should also be in your directory with the other files. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------

The fresh_tomatoes.py was provided by Udacity. I made a few edits to
add actor and storyline info to the movie tiles. I also mixed up the
font for fun.
